# üìï Portfolio 
Below you can find game dev projects I worked on with a short description of what I was responsible for in creation process of those games.üòä

# 1 Tales of the Pirate Bay
A simple platformer game developed by a team of four, for 6week project. All the assets come from [Treasure Hunters](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters) asset pack created by Pixel Frog. It was my first game dev project and I am very proud of it, although I would probably aproach it differently now. Here you can find short trailer of the game:
