# üìï Portfolio 
Below you can find game dev projects I worked on with a short description of what I was responsible for in creation process of those games.üòä

# 1. Tales of the Pirate Bay
A simple platformer game developed by a team of four, for 6week project. All the assets come from [Treasure Hunters](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters) asset pack created by Pixel Frog. It was my first game dev project and I am very proud of it, although I would probably aproach it differently now.<br/>

Parts of the game that I made:
* LEVEL 1 design
* Game obstacles mechanics design
* Hidden rooms mechanic design
* Totems scripts
* Canon scripts
* Falling cannonball scripts
* Moving ship scripts
* Background clouds script
* Game Tutorial
* Participated in Game Design Document creation

# 2. [The Castle](https://github.com/Cyranixonpj/Culture_Jam_Austria_2024) 
An old-school adventure game created during a 24-hour [Culture Jam: Austria](https://itch.io/jam/culture-jam-austria). Development team consisted of 4 programmers, 2 designers and 4 artists. Here you can find [itch.io](https://romulus162.itch.io/the-castle) page with working game build which I suggest to download as .zip file for better experience.  

Parts of the game I was responsible for:
* Main menu and Pause menu UI scripts and Sounds
* Player movement including scripts and animations
* Levels polishing and testing

# 3. [Need more UPUP](https://github.com/Cyranixonpj/Pjatk_GameJam_2024)
